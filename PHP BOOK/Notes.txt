- Different Method Types - 
    Short style ($tireqty) is convenient but requires the register_globals configuration setting be turned on. 
    For security reasons, this setting is turned off by default.This style makes it easy to make errors that could make your code insecure, 
    which is why it is no longer the recommended approach. It would be a bad idea to use this style in a new code as the option is likely to disappear in PHP6.
    
    Medium style ($_POST[‘tireqty’]) is the recommended approach.  If you create short versions of variable names, 
    based on the medium style (as we do in this book), it is not a security issue and instead is simply on ease-of-use 
    issue.03_0672329166_ch01.qxd

    Long style ($HTTP_POST_VARS[‘tireqty’]) is the most verbose. Note, however,that it is deprecated and is therefore likely 
    to be removed in the long term.This style used to be the most portable but can now be disabled via the register_long_arrays configuration 
    directive, which improves performance. So again using it in new code is probably not a good idea unless you have reason to think that your 
    software is particularly likely to be installed on old servers.
